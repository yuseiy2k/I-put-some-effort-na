I fell for the way you laugh, the kindness in your eyes, and how your presence makes everything feel a little lighter. Its the way you make me want to be a better person. My heart trembles everytime I saw you. even you do have flaws I never see them. You shines so perfectly, There isnt a day that goes by where I dont think of you.",
